Multiple Comparison Procedures
==============================

### Family-Wise Error Rates (FWER)

This is the probability of making one or more false discovery, or type 1 error, among all the hypotheses when performing multiple
pairwise tests.

### Experimentwise Error Rate

This is the probability of at least one false rejection of the null hypothesis over an entire experiment during
multiple comparison tests.
The alpha assigned applies to all the hypotheses tests as a whole, not individually, as in the comparison error rate.
